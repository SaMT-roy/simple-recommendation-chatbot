      "Chambers and valves of the heart Open pop-up dialog box Close Chambers and valves of the heart Chambers and valves of the heart A typical heart has two upper and two lower chambers. The upper chambers, the right and left atria, receive incoming blood. The lower chambers, the more muscular right and left ventricles, pump blood out of the heart. The heart valves, which keep blood flowing in the right direction, are gates at the chamber openings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your heart is a pump. It's a muscular organ about the size of your fist, located slightly left of center in your chest. Your heart is divided into the right and the left sides.\n",
      "\n",
      "The right side of the heart includes the right atrium and ventricle. It collects and pumps blood to the lungs through the pulmonary arteries.\n",
      "\n",
      "The lungs give the blood a new supply of oxygen. The lungs also breathe out carbon dioxide, a waste product.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oxygen-rich blood then enters the left side of the heart, including the left atrium and ventricle.\n",
      "\n",
      "The left side of the heart pumps blood through the largest artery in the body (aorta) to supply tissues throughout the body with oxygen and nutrients.\n",
      "\n",
      "Heart valves\n",
      "\n",
      "Four heart valves keep your blood moving the right way by opening only one way and only when they need to. To work properly, the valves must be formed properly, must open all the way and must close tightly so there's no leakage. The four valves are:\n",
      "\n",
      "Tricuspid\n",
      "\n",
      "Mitral\n",
      "\n",
      "Pulmonary\n",
      "\n",
      "Aortic\n",
      "\n",
      "Heartbeats\n",
      "\n",
      "A beating heart squeezes (contracts) and relaxes in a continuous cycle.\n",
      "\n",
      "During contraction (systole), your ventricles squeeze tight, forcing blood into the vessels to your lungs and body.\n",
      "\n",
      "During relaxation (diastole), the ventricles are filled with blood coming from the upper chambers (left and right atria).\n",
      "\n",
      "Electrical system\n",
      "\n",
      "Your heart's electrical wiring keeps it beating. Your heartbeat controls the continuous exchange of oxygen-rich blood with oxygen-poor blood. This exchange keeps you alive.\n",

      "Electrical signals begin high in the upper right chamber (right atrium) and travel through specialized pathways to the ventricles, delivering the signal for the heart to pump.\n",

      "Development of atherosclerosis Open pop-up dialog box Close Development of atherosclerosis Development of atherosclerosis If you have too many cholesterol particles in your blood, cholesterol may accumulate on your artery walls. Eventually, deposits called plaques may form. The deposits may narrow — or block — your arteries. These plaques can also burst, causing a blood clot to form.\n",

      "In a healthy person with a normal, healthy heart, it's unlikely for a deadly arrhythmia to develop without some outside trigger, such as an electrical shock or the use of illegal drugs. However, in a heart that's diseased or deformed, the heart's electrical signals may not properly start or travel through the heart, making arrhythmias more likely to develop.\n",

      "Causes of congenital heart defects\n",
      "\n",
      "Congenital heart defects usually develop while a baby is in the womb. Heart defects can develop as the heart develops, about a month after conception, changing the flow of blood in the heart. Some medical conditions, medications and genes may play a role in causing heart defects.\n",
